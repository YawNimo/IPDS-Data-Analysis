 I conducted extensive data cleaning by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing text and numeric formats to ensure data integrity. I analyzed electric vehicle adoption trends in Washington, identifying the best-selling EV models and the cities with the highest adoption rates. Additionally, I examined the prevalence of hybrid versus fully electric vehicles, providing insights into market trends and consumer preferences. To further understand industry patterns, I investigated the correlation between vehicle range and production year, highlighting challenges in ultra-range EV production and potential market opportunities for manufacturers. To present these findings effectively, I developed interactive dashboards, enabling clear and data-driven decision-making.
